title: "rOpenSci Software Review Dashboard"
---

This dashboard provides an overview of all current [rOpenSci software review
issues](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues), and of editor
availability and past editorial workloads. The dashboard includes the following
components:

- The [*Editors* page](./editors.qmd) which provides information on current
  editors and activities. This page helps the Editor-in-Charge identify
  editors for new submissions, and gives each editor an overview of their
  current and previous editorial portfolios.
- The [*Software Review* page](./reviews.qmd) which provides an overview of all
  currently open submissions to the software peer-review system. This page is
  primarily intended to provide an overview of the current state of software
  peer-review for the Editors-in-Charge, and in particular to identify reviews
  in need of attention.
- The [*Historical Data* page](./history.qmd) which gives insights into
  the historical developments of the software peer-review program.
